  alt-text: "The figure illustrates a sequence of gameplay across analog and digital sessions. In the first step, a group of players is engaged in an analog session. Between the first and second steps, an illustration depicts enemies from the analog session escaping, requiring players to confront them in a digital session. The second step shows the players participating in this digital session. Transitioning to the third step, an illustration highlights players unlocking physical cards during the digital session, which can then be used in the analog session. Finally, the third step depicts the players returning to the analog session to continue the game." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Game experiences can span multiple play sessions, which may evoke a sense of continuity. In this work, first, we investigate how the sense of continuity is perceived in digital and analog games. Second, we explore how players believe this sense can be achieved in experiences that transition between digital and analog sessions (i.e. transmedial play)."
