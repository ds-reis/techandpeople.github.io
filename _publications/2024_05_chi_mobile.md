# short description of the publication
description: "While web accessibility evaluations have received extensive attention, evaluating mobile applications remains an open question. In our paper, we explore this issue through four studies: analyzing accessibility reports from European Member-states, interviewing accessibility experts, conducting manual evaluations, and performing usability tests with users having disabilities. Our findings reveal significant limitations in current evaluation methods, primarily due to the absence of authoritative guidelines and standards. We propose a set of recommendations aimed at improving the evaluation methodologies for assessing mobile applications’ accessibility."
