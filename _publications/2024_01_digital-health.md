# short description of the publication
description: "We analysed the role of non-clinical factors (i.e. computer confidence and computer self-efficacy) in the interaction experience (IX) and the feasibility of a digital neuropsychological platform called NeuroVRehab.PT in a group of older adults with varying levels of computer confidence. This study shed light on the barriers raised by non-clinical factors in adopting and using digital healthcare services by older adults. Furthermore, we did a critical analysis of the platform’s features that promote user adoption, and presented suggestions for overcoming limitations."
