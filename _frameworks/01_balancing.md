# short description of the framework

description: "The Design Space for Player Balancing Mechanics captures design aspects to consider when designing mechanics to balance competition or collaboration between two or more players in a game. It can serve as a tool to ideate, fine-tune, and report future designs of player balancing, as well as to deconstruct and analyze existing ones. It can be particularly important to better understand how specific implementations shape player experience and other perceptions (e.g., fairness). The design space comprises aspects that characterize balancing mechanics in terms of their 1) Determination (i.e. who and what determines its Existence, Activation, and Configuration), 2) Timing (i.e. when and for how long it happens), 3) Targeting (i.e. which players it affects), 4) Effect (i.e. how intense it is and how much it depends on variable factors), 5) Feedback (i.e. how visible it is), and 6) type of Information used for system decision."
