# short description of the publication
description: "In this work, we reflect on the potential of WildKey, a privacy-aware keyboard that collects text-entry data in the wild, as a digital footprint for health monitoring and disease detection. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges of digital footprints, namely their potential for continuous and reliable monitoring, and the associated privacy and ethical concerns."
