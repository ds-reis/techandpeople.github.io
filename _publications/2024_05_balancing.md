  alt-text: "The image shows two panels - each of them consists of a screenshot taken from the game, demonstranting one of the mechanics. In both of them, there is a blue penguin on a red floater centered on a white snowy track, facing forward. The trail behind the floater indicates it is moving forward. The left panel shows the timed gate - a gate appears blocking the entire track, with a cobbled floor in that area and a traffic light. The right panel shows the activation of the forced handbrake - red particles appear behind the floater." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Disparate skill levels or expertise may result in unbalanced multiplayer experiences, where players feel frustrated, unchallenged, or left out. Some games employ player balancing mechanisms, such as matchmaking to group players according to their rank or, in racing games, players who lag behind receiving powerful boosts to catch up. We add to the understanding of player balancing in multiplayer gaming. First with a theoretical model that captures seven high-level design categories. Second, with a study where participant pairs experienced and gave their perspectives on seven different balancing mechanics in a racing game. Our results outline the importance of preserving a sense of merit and agency, while avoiding an obtrusive effect on the gameplay."
