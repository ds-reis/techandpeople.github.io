# short description of the publication
description: "CLOCK4PD is a mono-centric, non-interventional observational study aiming at the molecular characterization of CR alterations in PD. We further plan to determine physiological modifications in sleep and activity patterns, and clinical factors correlating with the observed CR changes. Our study may provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between CR and PD with a potential to be used as a predictor of circadian alterations reflecting distinct disease phenotypes, symptoms, and progression outcomes."
