# short description of the publication
description: "We used an iterative participatory design approach to develop an authoring platform for therapists, enabling them to tailor VR environments during exposure by changing and parameterising elements and reapplying past scenes. We used this platform as a design probe in a study with ten therapists to elicit discussions about the design of VRET experiences and therapists' authoring needs"
