# short description of the publication
description: "We explored an approach whereby the robot’s agency is shifted to the older adults who lead the interaction by commanding a robot’s actions using interactive physical blocks (tangible blocks). We conducted sessions with 22 care home dwellers where they could exchange messages and objects using the robot. We reflect on the opportunities and challenges for increased user agency and the asymmetries that emerged from differing abilities and personality traits."
