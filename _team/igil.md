I have a Bachelor's Degree in Design and Multimedia from the University of Coimbra, a program that combines programming and graphic/web design.

My main areas of interest include design, game development, and 3D modeling. I'm highly motivated by what I create, and I consider myself to be creative, dedicated, dynamic, and capable of working in a team.

Drawing, music, and gaming are some of my hobbies.
