# short description of the publication
description: "Phishing has become a pervasive threat to our society. Current phishing countermeasures depend strongly on vision, often inadequate for screen reader users. We conducted 10 semi-structured interviews and 14 lab-based sessions with screen reader users to understand their phishing experiences and defenses. Our work hints at opportunities for more accessible phishing prevention."
