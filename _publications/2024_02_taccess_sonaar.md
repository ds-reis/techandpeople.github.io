description: "This paper introduces SONAAR, a tool that merges automated techniques with user involvement to improve social media accessibility. SONAAR is designed to assist users in creating accessible content by providing both automated suggestions and manual input options. The study evaluates the tool’s impact through a series of user studies and log analysis, examining how well it supports users in producing accessible content and promotes awareness of accessibility practices. The findings highlight the tool’s potential to enhance accessibility efforts on social media platforms."
