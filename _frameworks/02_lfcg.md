It serves as a tool for analysis and ideation, and as a shared language for describing a gameâ€™s design. LFCG is published as a web application to facilitate use and appropriation. It supports the creation, dissemination and aggregation of game reports and specifications; and enables stakeholders to extend and publish custom versions."
