# short description of the game

description: "Sled Racing is a simple racing game, where each player controls a penguin sitting on a floater going down an ice track. Based on an existing open-source game, this prototype adds options to enable player balancing mechanics (also known as catch-up mechanics) which seek to bring players closer in performance. These mechanics include speed boosts, new obstacles, and other changes to the gameplay."
