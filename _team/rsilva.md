A highly motivated and enthusiastic recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in Information Technologies from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon, with a passion for technology and a constant drive to keep learning.

I am currently continuing my studies by pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering, with a specialization in games and virtual environments. At the moment, I am working on my thesis in the area of human interaction, focusing on designing accessible health trackers with blind people.
