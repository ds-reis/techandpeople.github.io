I completed my PhD in Biology in 2020 at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon, where I explored the grape berry response to powdery mildew infection using omics approaches, including transcriptome analysis, and metabolic and hormonal profiling. Following my PhD, I worked as a Biostatistics Technician at InnovPlantProtect CoLab in Elvas. There I developed statistical models to study pest dynamics under field conditions and created automated data analysis tools to enhance efficiency and reproducibility. In addition to my professional work, I completed a second MSc in Statistics at the University of Minho.


Currently, I am a researcher at LASIGE, contributing to the IDEA-FAST project: Identifying Digital Endpoints to Assess FAtigue, Sleep and acTivities daily living in Neurodegenerative disorders and Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
