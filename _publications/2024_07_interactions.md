 alt-text: "A classroom with two groups of teachers and students around one table. There is a table at the back with 4 students (1st to 4th grade) and two male teachers. A reseacher on the left of the picture moves from the back table to the front table. At the front table are 3 students (1st to 4th grade), two researchers working with them, and a teacher. On the closer table, there are LEGO-baseplates, one with a LEGO-based map and another where children are placing tangible blocks to program the robot on the map." # provide a short description for the image #a11y
