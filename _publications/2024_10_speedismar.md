 alt-text: "Sound scheme representing the target's location in each condition; clock, degree, and sonification. A blue circle represents the user's head and red circles the targets."

# short description of the publication
description: This paper described the desing of three types of auditory feedback that convey the position of targets within a 3D space, exploring a horizontal interaction setting. A user study with 8 visually impaired participants revealed good performances and overall enjoyment of the game, especially when using verbal feedback (rather than sonification)."
