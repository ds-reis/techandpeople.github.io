I am a MSc student at the Faculty of Sciences, at University of Lisbon, currently developing my thesis "GymAccessAR: Making Physical Spaces Accessible with Augmented Reality", under the supervision of Prof. Jo√£o Guerreiro.

My academic path reflects dedication, curiosity, and ambition to design innovative, human-centered solutions. I am particularly motivated by the challenge of leveraging emerging technologies to create inclusive and impactful experiences.
