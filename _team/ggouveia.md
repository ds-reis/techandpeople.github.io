I am a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon, currently developing my thesis titled Virtual TV Remote Controller for Users with Cerebral Palsy, under the supervision of Prof. Carlos Duarte and Daniel Freitas. I also hold a BSc in Computer Science from the same faculty, where I established the foundations of my academic journey.

Throughout this path, I have cultivated strong interest in areas related to my masterâ€™s studies, while also embracing the challenge of exploring new and socially impactful fields, even when not directly aligned with my previous background. I am driven to acquire new experiences and remain up to date with current technologies and methodologies, both in research and professional contexts, with the goal of applying them in innovative, practical, and meaningful ways.

I have also been recognized with academic merit awards, reflecting my dedication as a student, and have pursued music studies for many years as a long-term extracurricular passion.
