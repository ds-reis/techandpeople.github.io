  alt-text: "The image demonstrates the Point and Teleport locomotion technique. There is a view of the user with the controller and the visuals conveyed in the Head Mounted Display. The visuals show the controller pointing to the pretended area the user wants to be teleported to and a visual representation of the objective on the back." # provide a short description for the image #a11y

# short description of the publication
description: "Many Virtual Reality (VR) locomotion techniques have been proposed, but those explored for and with blind people are often custom-made or require specialized equipment. We implemented three popular techniques — Arm Swinging, Linear Movement, and Point & Teleport — with minor adaptations for accessibility. We conducted a study with 14 blind participants consisting of navigation tasks with these techniques and a semi-structured interview. We found no differences in overall performance, but contrasting preferences. We discuss how augmenting the techniques enabled blind people to navigate in VR, the greater control of movement of Arm Swinging, the simplicity and familiarity of Linear Movement, and the potential for efficiency and for scanning the environment of Point & Teleport."
