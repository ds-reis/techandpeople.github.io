 alt-text: "Includes four images. The first one a), is a typical physical Speed-of-Light game machine, containing a 6x5 blue button grid. The other images explain the 3 implemented techniques, on a 3x3 blue button grid, to provide awareness of active buttons to visually impaired people. On the b) image, that portrays the Speech Feedback technique, the active button, represented in red, is located in the bottom row and middle column (i.e., third row and second column) and a Bottom Middle audio notification is played. The c) image is referred to the Sonification technique, where the active button is located in the first row and third column, and is playing a (high pitch) sound. The last image, d), depicts the 2D Grid Position technique. In this technique, each column is represented by a letter - from the left to the right - A, B, C, D; and each row is represented by a number - from the top to the bottom - 1, 2, 3. The active button is located in the third row and first column, and so the audio notification played is A3."
