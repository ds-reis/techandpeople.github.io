 alt-text: "An animated gif capturing the gameplay. Its overall look consists of pixel art and dark ambience. It shows a submarine, seen from the side, which approaches a wall of rocks. A mechanical claw protruding from the submarine's hatch aims towards a colored rock which is actually a mineral. The central area is lit by a spotlight around the submarine and the mineral, and everything outside of that is black."

# short description of the game
