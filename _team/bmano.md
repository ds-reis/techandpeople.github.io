I got my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico in 2016, and then moved to Finland to complete my MSc in Machine Learning and Data Mining at Aalto University. Since then, I’ve been working in the biotech industry, using AI to tackle various healthcare challenges involving diverse types of data, such as genomic data, demographic and nutritional information, electronic health records (EHR), and motion data, just to name a few.

In early 2024, I kicked off my PhD, where I aim to use deep learning with different types of data to make clinical procedures (e.g. ultrasound) more accurate and effective. It’s still early days, but I’m really excited about where this research could lead.
