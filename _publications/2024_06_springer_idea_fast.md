# short description of the publication
description: "This study explored the relationships between gait characteristics derived from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and patient-reported fatigue in the IDEA-FAST feasibility study. Participants with neurodegenerative and immune-mediated infammatory disorders wore a lower-back IMU continuously for up to 10 days at home. Concurrently, participants completed PROs (physical fatigue and mental fatigue) up to four times a day."
