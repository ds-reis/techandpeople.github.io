# short description of the publication
description: "Charts on the web are often inaccessible to screen reader users due to the lack of expertise and time data visualization experts have for creating accessible charts. To address this, we developed AutoVizuA11y, a tool that automates accessibility features for web-based charts, generating human-like descriptions, statistical insights, and providing keyboard navigation. In usability tests with fifteen screen reader users, thirteen praised AutoVizuA11y for its intuitive design and rich information, achieving an average task completion time of 66 seconds and a success rate of 89%. The tool received an 'Excellent' SUS score of 83.5/100, and data visualization experts appreciated its ease of use and suggested expanding its support to other technologies."
